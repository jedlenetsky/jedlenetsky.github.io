My name is Jed Lenetsky and I'm a PhD Candidate at the University of Colorado - Boulder. I am  physical oceanographer whose interested in using ocean observations and climate models to improve understanding of the variability and impacts of Arctic - Subarctic ocean exchanges.  

## Current Projects

# Davis Strait Observing System
The Davis Strait, located between the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and West Greenland in southern Baffin Bay, is a key region of oceanic exchange between the Arctic Ocean and Subpolar North Atlantic. In this region, fresh polar surface waters enter the Labrador Sea, potentially influencing watermass transformations and AMOC, and warm, saline, Atlantic origin waters enter Baffin Bay, prividing a source of oceanic heat to marine terminating glaciers. Given the Davis Strait's regional and global importance, the Davis Strait Observing System has mantained a mooring array at Davis Strait since 2004. As part of my PhD, I am processing and gridding mooring measurements from the 2004-2024, and updating our ocean transport time series to cover the 2004 - 2024 period.

# Future changes to the North Water Polynya
The North Water Polynya (NOW), located in northern Baffin Bay between Greenland and the Canadian Arctic, is one of the most productive ecosystems in the Arctic Ocean. In our study, currently under review at Journal of Climate, we explore how future changes in sea ice cover and ocean stratification under 2 and 3.5 degrees of warming can influence biologicial productivity in the NOW region.
